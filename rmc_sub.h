// rmc_sub.h - Handle packets subscribed to.
//  This file contains data structures and functions to handle incoming packets

//  The functions in here are network agnostic and only deals with

// Packet has been received via multicast or tcp.
// Packet can be in one of the following queues.
//
// publisher->received
//   Packet has been received but cannot be processed due to missing packets
//   with lower pids, forming holes in the receive stream.
//
// publisher->dispatch_ready.
//    Packet is ready to be procesed by the caller through sub_get_next_dispatch_ready()
//    calls.
//
// publisher->ack_ready
//    The packet has been dispatched and is ready to be acknowledged back to the
//    the publisner.
//
//
// Call sequence to propagate packet is:
//
// sub_packet_received()
//   Packet has been received from network and is pending processing.
//
// sub_process_received_packets()
//   Move all consequtive packets, ready to be dispatched, from received to dispatch_ready queue.
//
// sub_packet_dispatched()
//   Packet has been processed by caller. Move from dispatch_ready to ack_ready queue.
//
// sub_packet_acknowledged()
//   Packet has been acknowledged to publisher and can be freed.
//   **Please note that the caller still has to free packet->payload**
